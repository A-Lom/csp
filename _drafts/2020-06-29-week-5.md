With the first update being released next week. I had to get the last 3 levels completed before opening up the project to the public. Because with Update 1.0 I needed to have a way to collect feedback and critique on each of the levels. I also thought it would be a good idea to have a page to link to each of the levels and gave a difficulty on them.[^1]

## Levels 8 to 10
These were the last couple of levels and I didn't want to setup the difficulty higher than moderate for the first set of levels. So I went to work drafting some interesting plans and ideas (Nothing really came to mind). But anyhow I was able to create some challenges for these levels anyway.

## Update 1.0 and feedback prep

With Update 1.0 looming over me for next week. I had to work hard to get the work I was working on complete before Monday. I created a google forum to collect feedback on the levels so I could improve them over the holidays and term 3. [^2]
