Week 4 was a tough week. It involved working with php for the server scripting for levels 5,6 and 7. PHP being a new language for me it did require a bit of learning to work out how to create scripts for it and implement them into the levels.

## Some errors
In the creation of level 6 I was having to put up with quite a few errors. Mainly getting the level to communicate with a SQL database. But once I got the connection working I was able to set up the rest of the system(Which I can't say without giving away the solution of the level)
