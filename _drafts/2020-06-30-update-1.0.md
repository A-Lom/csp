To get started head <a href="/">here</a> and have a look at how you solve each of the levels. Each level involves a puzzle of increasing difficulty to the previous one. A list of levels and their skill requirements can be found <a href="/levels">here</a> or by clicking the Levels tab at the top.

## Feedback
Feedback is one of the most important things for me when creating and tweaking these puzzles. You can complete a forum to provide me with feedback by clicking <a href="https://forms.gle/LZeDriP36kjMZ96j8">here</a> or by clicking the Feedback tab at the top.
