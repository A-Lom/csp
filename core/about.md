### What is this?

The Computer Science Puzzle is my (Alex Lombard) full year project for computer science. It involves players (You) solving puzzles to find the passwords for each page. A password could be plain text, encrypted or just well hidden. 

### Why did I make this?
I made this because I thought it would be a cool project to work on in my final year of school. My inspiration for the project was the New Zealand Cyber Security Challenge[^1], Natas by OverTheWire[^2]. 
Both of these projects where things I enjoyed taking part in, in previous years and still do to this day
