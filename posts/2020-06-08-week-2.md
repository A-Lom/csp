Welcome to Week 2's Dev Log. I'm happy to announce that this week we have managed to create the first two levels, created the about page and finished off information about how to take part in the puzzles.

After a bit of time working out how to word the instructions I believe I finally came up with a way that looks like it makes sense and would help you with the first level. I also worked on the about page and talked about what the puzzle is and why I created it. (*I might add more information to this page in the future but otherwise I think it is in a state that I'm happy with*)

The first two levels were some good fun to create. Obviously I need to create an easy beginning to the puzzles with something simple for almost anyone to solve. So there is only 1 page and not much experience needed to solve. While level 2 involves a bit more of a logical thought process and contains multiple pages.[^1]

[^1]: In future Dev Logs I won't be adding as much information on each level. This way people have to think about how to solve each puzzle as there can sometimes be multiple ways to solve the level.
