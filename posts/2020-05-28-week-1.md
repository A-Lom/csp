<!-- Have a look at the first letter of each sentence. -->

Welcome to the first ever Dev Log for The Computer Science Puzzle. Each week I plan to use these posts to log the work I have done over the week. They will contain information on progress of levels and plans for future updates. So without further ado here is week 1's Dev Log.

After 1 week I am happy to present this website which I have finally managed to configure and setup so that I am able to create this Dev Log. Also a custom configuration of style and layout. I have started working plans for the first two levels in the puzzle and how they will work.
